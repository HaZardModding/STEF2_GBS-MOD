//Illia
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/illia/afterserved.mp3 After serving drinks to you Starfleet types all day, I have to vent some steam.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/illia/whatcanidoforyou.mp3 What can I do for you?
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/illia/iwillsee.mp3 I'll check.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/illia/anythingelse.mp3 Is there anything else?
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/ahyes.mp3 Ah, yes. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/twobottles.mp3 There are two bottles.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/shouldbeenough.mp3 Should be enough.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/doinghere.mp3 What are you doing here? 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/notinformed.mp3 Didn't they tell you? 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/donotbelong.mp3 I'm not part of the agency anymore. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/unrealistic.mp3 It must be unrealistic to expect a scrap of gratitude for rescuing the Alpha Quadrant. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/paranoia.mp3 Has your paranoia progressed so far in corroding your brain, Stevens? 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/nomissions.mp3 No missions for me anymore.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/enterprise.mp3 We are onboard the Enterprise? 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/captainpicard.mp3 If I were you, I'd be careful that Captain Picard doesn't find out that members of our esteemed organization are on his ship. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/thirtyone.mp3 Word is, he is on bad terms with Thirty-One. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/experience.mp3 Will not be a pleasant experience.  
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/includingme.mp3 Including me. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/send.mp3 Send someone else.  
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/notinshape.mp3 I'm not in shape anymore. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/theatlantic.mp3 Captain Mankell won't just let me fly away with one of his shuttles. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/neutralzone.mp3 And how am I to get through the Neutral Zone in a Starfleet shuttle? 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/romulanspace.mp3 To say nothing of Romulan Space itself...  
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/onlytowell.mp3 Only too well. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/stevenswasgone.mp3 Stevens was gone, I was on my own. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/myplan.mp3 My plan was simple. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Illia/sabotage.mp3 Get into engineering, sabotage the engines and escape with a shuttle. 


//Stevens
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/msericsson.mp3 Miss Ericcson, we meet again.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/membership.mp3 Membership in Thirty-One lasts as long as one is alive.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/terminate.mp3 Although, if you allow me the remark, you'd be neither a member nor alive anymore, if I made the decisions. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/hetlek.mp3 What you did in the Hetlek system was simply inexcusable.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/thirtyone.mp3 I would have expected that all the years in Thirty-One had cured you from such naivety.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/job.mp3 But enough of that: We have a mission for you.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/nochoice.mp3 You don't have a choice.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/offertodrink.mp3 May I offer you something to drink, Miss Ericcson? 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/picard.mp3 Captain Picard is the least of my worries. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/situation.mp3 We have a situation at hand that makes your services imperative. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/member.mp3 An important member of our organization has fallen into the hands of the Romulan secret service, the Tal'shiar. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/graveness.mp3 You don't recognize the graveness of the situation. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/important.mp3 The stress is on 'important member'. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/sigmacell.mp3 He knows the identities of all members of the Sigma Cell. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/agents.mp3 More than forty agents. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/helpus.mp3 Now you understand, why it's in your best interest to help us. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/sleepwell.mp3 If you ever hope to sleep safe and sound again, without fear of assassination by the Tal'shiar, you have to prevent the Romulans from getting that information. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/manytried.mp3 Believe me, several agents have tried. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/noonecameback.mp3 Not a single one of them even reached the system where he's being held captive. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/lasthope.mp3 I don't like to say this, but you are our last hope to retain this information.  
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/theplan.mp3 The plan:  
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/neutralzone.mp3 Borrow one of Atlantic's shuttles and fly to the Neutral Zone. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/sabotage.mp3 Then you'll have to deactivate the Atlantic's Warp engines first. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/please.mp3 Please, Ms. Ericcson, you're no amateur after all.  
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/antioch.mp3 Fly to the Antioch System on the border of the Neutral Zone.  
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/vessel.mp3 A vessel is waiting for you there.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/oberth.mp3 It will take you to the third planet in the Oberth System, where our man is being held captive. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/save.mp3 If you can save him: Great.  
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/success.mp3 But I'd also consider the mission a success if he wasn't able to pass his knowledge to the Romulans anymore. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/understand.mp3 I'm sure you understand.  
70	localization/sound/dialog/map02/Stevens/goodluck.mp3 Good luck then, Ms. Ericcson.
