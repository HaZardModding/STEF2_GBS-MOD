This contains language specific dialogs: ENGLISH

The reason why this is seperate is that dialogs are always end in the language
of the server. A German client on a English server will always have the English
Dialog played and vice versa.

To prevent this the only solution we have found this far is to only store the
language desired to be played in the base folder. For this we had to split up
the language specific files into seperate pk3.
