# STEF2_GBS-MOD - A Gate two Birds and the beautiful Sky
The A Gate two Birds and the beautiful Sky modification is an open-source project developed by The Colonists. Made for Star Trek: Elite Force II by Ritual Entertainment.

The GBS adds an all-new Singleplayer adventure to the game. The story centers around Illia Ericcson, a former agent of Section 31 the Federation's most secret intelligence agency.

Illia's final mission proves to be her most dangerous one yet, as she faces impossible opposition in Romulan space.

Development of Gate-Birds-Sky is coordinated by Stefan "Argyle" Hudelmaier and Lars Tiefland, who brought you the award-winning mod Colony 7 for Star Trek: Voyager Elite Force.
