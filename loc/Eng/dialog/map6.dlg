70	localization/sound/dialog/map06/stevens/goodday.mp3 Good day, Miss Ericcson. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map06/stevens/recorded.mp3 This is a recorded message, of course. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map06/stevens/ihope.mp3 I hope you like your new vehicle. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map06/stevens/wehave.mp3 We have lured the Warbird here using a false emergency signal from a Romulan cargo ship. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map06/stevens/insteadof.mp3 Instead of a ship, the Romulans were facing the newest biological weapon in the arsenal of Section 31. 
        localization/sound/dialog/map06/stevens/enterprise.mp3 Supplied by the Enterprise herself from the Attrexian sector. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map06/stevens/exomorphs.mp3 The 'Exomorphs' as they are called will dispose of themselves after they are finished with the Romulans, but as we haven't done extensive tests yet, it's entirely possible that the conditioning didn't work on all of them. 
70	localization/sound/dialog/map06/stevens/iamsure.mp3 So expect some residual Exomorph activity on the ship. 

70	localization/sound/dialog/map06/illia/uneventful.mp3 The voyage to the Antioch system was pretty short and completely uneventful.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map06/illia/surprise.mp3 Quite a surprise was waiting for me there however.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map06/Illia/notrace.mp3 There was no sign of Steven's vessel.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map06/Illia/ruins.mp3 The only thing the sensors showed, were the ruins of a Klingon outpost on the third planet.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map06/Illia/begin.mp3 I decided to start looking there.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map06/Illia/ihadmydoubts.mp3 I had my doubts about wether or not the ship would blow when I switched on the singularity drive.
70	localization/sound/dialog/map06/Illia/proof.mp3 The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
